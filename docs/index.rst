Qiskit RNG is a collaboration between `Cambridge Quantum Computing <https://cambridgequantum.com/>`_ (CQC)
and `IBM Quantum <https://www.ibm.com/quantum-computing/>`_ 
for generating certified quantum randomness using IBM Quantum systems running three-qubit
GHZ states with random X- and Y-measurements.  Provided that the state is tripartite entangled,
as measurement by a violation of the Mermin inequality (:math:`x,y\in \{1,2\}`):

.. math::

   M_{\rm obs} = \langle A_{1}B_{1}C_{1}\rangle - \langle A_{1}B_{2}C_{2}\rangle - \langle A_{2}B_{1}C_{2}\rangle - \langle A_{2}B_{2}C_{1}\rangle  \le 2,

the measured output can be certified quantum random for values :math:`2\sqrt{2} \le M_{\rm obs} \le 4`; the underlying
state was truly tripartite entangled.  The maximum value :math:`M_{\rm obs} = 4` indicates maximum randomness, and
and that the measurement outcomes are uniformly random. These "raw bits" are passed through a two-source randomness extractor
that creates a reduced length uniform random distribution (if :math:`M_{\rm obs} \neq 4`) of bits.

Further technical details maybe found in:
`Foreman et al., "Practical randomness and privacy amplification", arXiv:2009.06551 <https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06551>`_.

``qiskit_rng`` has passed the following RNG test suites:

- `Dieharder <https://webhome.phy.duke.edu/~rgb/General/dieharder.php>`_

- `NIST Statistical Test Suite <https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/random-bit-generation/documentation-and-software>`_

Quick start
-----------

.. code-block:: python

  from qiskit import IBMQ
  from qiskit_rng import Generator

  IBMQ.load_account()
  rng_provider = IBMQ.get_provider(hub='qrng')
  backend = rng_provider.backends.ibmq_ourence

  generator = Generator(backend=backend)
  output = generator.sample(num_raw_bits=1024).block_until_ready()

  random_bits = output.extract(rng_provider)
